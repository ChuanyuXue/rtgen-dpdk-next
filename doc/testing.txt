for talker.c: 
-i: can only put in 0 for the port id? 
Other numbers result in an error. 
Strings work fine?

-q: throws an error if I put an int other than 0 - is this because we define 1 queue in flow.h?

--mac-dst: throws an error

-k: I think testing priority works

-d: seems to work for any ip address?
Even invalid ones - really any numbers in general (or strings)

-l: when I tried a traffic payload size of 10000, it gave confusing behavior. 
It seemed like packets weren't being sent. 
Trying negative numbers resulted in a segfault - implement error handling?

-h: works
