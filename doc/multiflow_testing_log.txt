This file is to log testing and results of running talker.c with the -m tag 


When it comes to the offset value, going lower than 60 microseconds causes the overall 
timing of the program to become unstable.

If the delta value is lower than the period, it causes each packet to be sent at around 
1 milisecond, regardless of offset value.

Can have at most two queues because of the hardcoded tx_queue value.
Can run multiple flows on the same queue.

Can only have a port number of 0, everything else causes an error 

mac-dst does seem to affect anything
same with port-dst and ip-dst

Changing size of packet works

Don't see any issues that are different from changing options in talker.c 

Sending multiple packets at the same time will only send the first one, even if they are 
in different queues
