for talker.c: 

-i, --port: can only put in 0 for the port id? 
Other numbers result in an error. 
Likely because only one port is defined.

-q, --queue: throws an error if I put an int other than 0 - is this because we define 1 queue in flow.h?

--mac-dst: I see no difference when using it. 
Any option I put after it seems to work

--vlan: works.
Values can range between 0-4095 since the vid is an unsi 12 bit number.
Putting in anything past that doesnt cause any errors, it just resets the count
For instance, putting in 4096 will cause the vid to be 0, 4097 will cause 1, etc.
For negative numbers, it just converts the bits to the corresponding unsigned 12-bit number.

-k, --priority: I think changing priority works, but I can't be certain cause there is nothing to run alongside it.

-d, --ip-dst: seems to work for any ip address?
Even invalid ones - really any numbers in general (or strings)

-p, --port-dst: not exactly sure what this does but changing the value doesn't seem to really affect the program

-o, --delta: changing the delta_time seemed to work, at least in the range of 10,000-100,000,000ns.
The hardware timestamp starts looking a little funky but the txttime remains consistent (as shown in terminal output)

-t, --period: when the cycle period passed in gets too large (a little over 2 seconds). it gets strange.
The period becomes a seemingly random number and it doesn't always work.
The period can go much smaller than 1 second and still work.
Probably a overflow error because the largest int that can be supported in C is 2,147,483,647.
When I pass in 2100000000, it works just fine but passing in 2200000000 causes the error

-b, --offset: Looks like it works 

-l, --size: when I tried a traffic payload size of over 1500, it gave confusing behavior. 
It seemed like packets weren't being received? because in the Raspberry Pi terminal, the printout is confusing

-m: TODO

-a, --no-log: ignore for now

-v, --no-loop: ignore for now

-s, --no-rt: ignore for now

-w, --no-stamp: hardware stamping looks disabled as it should

-h, --help: I think the passed in arguments for the print (i.e. DEFAULT_PAYLOAD) were put in the wrong order originally
I commented out the arguments and wrote what I think they should be
